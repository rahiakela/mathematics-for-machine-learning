        "A random variable $X$ is a function that represents a random phenomenon, meaning its exact value cannot be determined. However, probabilities can be assigned to a set of possible values it can take. For example, if $X$ has a uniform distribution on $[2, 4]$, we cannot determine the exact value of $X$, but we can say with a probability of $1$ that the value lies between $[2, 4]$. We can also say that:\n",

Therefore, you have learned that a random variable is associated with a function called the probability density function (pdf), which encodes the probability of the random variable falling within a given range. In other words, if $X$ is a continuous random variable and $f$ is its pdf, then:\n",

In other words, the new random variable $F(X)$ will be uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$. This opens up the possibility of generating artificial data with any desired distribution, given that we know $F$. The process is as follows:\n",
